title: "About"

I am a developer working at [develer](https://develer.com) where I can build a
lot of cool stuff working with great people. Currently I'm working on the
software for CNC cutting machines ranging from computer vision to motion
planning algorithms.

I have a broad range of interests, from functional programming and programming
language design to 3D renderers. Recently, I've been dabbling with generative
art and plotters.

This blog will collect my ramblings about whatever I find interesting or worth
to be written down.

If you wish to reach out to me, you can find me on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/danieledapo) and
