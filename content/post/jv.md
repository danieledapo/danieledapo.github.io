JSON is a really common format and I think it works well 90% of the time.
However, it's not perfect and it lacks some features that would be handy
sometimes.

In particular, it doesn't have a way to specify a reference to a value in the
document. A common solution is to store the id of the referenced object, but
it's not always possible (or convenient) to do so.

Anyway, it's trivial to come up with a custom string format that represents a
path to a value. For example, consider the following JSON document

```json
{
  "people": [{ "name": "Dan" }, { "name": "Luke" }, { "name": "Frank" }]
}
```

A very simple reference format could support the following queries:

- `#/` is the document root;
- `#/people` is the path to the "people" array;
- `#/people/0` maps to the first object inside the "people" array;
- `#/people/0/name` maps to the "name" of the first object inside the "people"
  array;

We could then store these paths inside the JSON document to express
relationships between values. For example, we could add a "brothers" key to
every object in the "people" array.

```json
{
  "people": [
    { "name": "Dan", "brothers": ["#/people/2"] },
    { "name": "Luke" },
    { "name": "Frank", "brothers": ["#/people/0"] }
  ]
}
```

At work I have to deal with JSON documents like these all the time and I can say
they're particularly annoying to inspect because they require a lot of jumping
between values. At the time, I was using [jq] to query the document but, besides
having to convert the above reference format to the one jq likes, there doesn't
seem to exist a sort of "interactive jq" that supports moving inside a JSON
document and jumping to the reference under the cursor.

Eventually I was so frustrated that I decided to shave this yak by myself and I
started [jv]: a terminal application to quickly inspect json documents with
first class support for jumping to references.

## Viewer

To start things off, I started implementing all the basic features like cursor
movement, paging, line truncation, JSON syntax highlighting, formatting, etc...
and things were going smoothly until one night I realized I was doing it wrong.

All the code I wrote up until that moment was assuming that each character would
take up exactly one column when printed to the terminal, but that is not always
the case! In fact, a lot of Unicode characters, namely emojis or [CJK
ideographs][cjk ideographs], can span multiple columns!

Armed with hope, I tried to understand if there was some sort of table that
defines the width of every Unicode symbol when rendered. I went through the
[Unicode Annex #11][unicode annex #11] page which describes how to interoperate
with Asian character sets and I realized that the thing is tricky to handle to
say the least.

Since I don't have to deal with Unicode documents at work (and I'm lazy) I took
the shortest route that is to enforce that the input text contains only ASCII
characters.

Initially I thought this was the easiest part of the project, but I was so
wrong. This was the most annoying and energy consuming part of it.

## Tabs

If I can live without supporting Unicode characters, I do want to support tabs
mostly for a matter of honour. I think tabs should not be used anymore because
they're a thing of the past, but lots of software(e.g. Go, Make, the Linux
kernel, etc...) do not agree and instead they make heavy use of tabs.

Initially I thought that I could just simply replace each tab with 8 spaces or
whatever the tab width is and be done with it. Poor me.

Tabs are not always of a fixed size because they depend on the position they're
rendered from! In fact, a tab spans all the columns until the next tab stop
which is usually at every 8 columns. Hopefully the following examples will make
it more clear.

```shell
$ printf '########\tciaociao\t########'
# output: ########        ciaociao        ########

$ printf '########\tciao\t########'
# output: ########        ciao    ########

$ printf '#######\tX\t########'
# output: ####### X       ########
```

This was really annoying to implement because I don't like that the model has to
know how and where it will be rendered in order to change its representation. It
doesn't sound right to me. Anyway, with enough hacks I was able to get it
working.

## JV

After I managed to implement all of this, adding the real core functionality was
pretty much straightforward.

Here's a small demo that shows some of what [jv] can do.

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/233199.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/233199)

I plan to add some more features in the near-ish future. For example, it really
needs a search mode where you can search for plain strings inside the document.

## Conclusions

I'm not proud of the code I've written. I think there are a lot of abstractions
that I could have come up with to make the code cleaner and my life easier, but
I was so frustrated of all the hacks I had to put in the code that I didn't have
enough energy and will for refactoring.

Anyway, `jv` is already proving useful at my daily job so I'm done with it as of
now. It's not pretty, but it kinda works. After all, an ugly tool is still
better than nothing.
