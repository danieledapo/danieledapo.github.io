      Ascii Diagrams
    </a>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>The 25th challenge of <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/">last year AoC</a> was
particularly funny to solve because it didn&rsquo;t require a lot of programming, but
a bit of play and intuition. I don&rsquo;t want to reveal too much about the
challenge, but it&rsquo;s enough to say that drawing a chart or diagrams is quite
useful.</p>
<p>At the time I used <a href="https://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> without thinking too
much about it as it&rsquo;s a great piece of software and it worked great. However, I
wanted the final diagram to be ASCII so that I could embed it in source files.
As of now, graphviz has no such backend.</p>
<p>Now, a sane person might have looked into how to write such backend, but
instead I tried to create an ASCII diagram renderer from scratch. I created
<a href="github.com/d-dorazio/ascii-diagrams">ascii-diagrams</a>.</p>
<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>I decided to start very small so I decided to render blocks only at fixed
positions while trying to find the best edge arrangement to connect such blocks
automatically.</p>
<p>Given that positions are already known, rendering blocks was not particularly
hard. I had to pay a bit of attention to handle padding and margins properly,
but nothing too complicated.</p>
<p>On the other hand, finding a good arrangement of lines is more complicated
because a lot of factors have to be taken into account and fundamentally it&rsquo;s a
NP problem.</p>
<p>Since the search space is so huge, it&rsquo;s practically impossible to visit all the
possible solutions to find the best one. We have to resort to some form of
dynamic programming to find a solution &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; for our use cases.</p>
<p>The strategy I used eventually boils down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>start from the current best solution,</li>
<li>select an edge randomly,</li>
<li>select two points randomly on the blocks that are connected by the selected
edge,</li>
<li>find the shortest path between those two points,</li>
<li>if the overall diagram is &ldquo;simpler&rdquo; than the current solution then keep the
new solution, discard it otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<p>This process is repeated a bunch of times until no intersections are found or
up to a given number of times.</p>
<p>This simple process is actually able to give decent results, but all the magic
lies in how the initial solution is built.</p>
<p>For example, edges between adjacent blocks are always placed in the most
obvious way (just straight lines) because that&rsquo;s almost always the correct
layout. These edges are then excluded from the main tweaking algorithm as
they&rsquo;re hardly wrong.</p>
<p>The remaining edges are sorted by the logical distance between the blocks and
then placed in the best way. The reason the edges are processed according to
their &ldquo;logical&rdquo; length is that short edges are easier to get right, but more
importantly we don&rsquo;t want to get them too wrong because shorter edges should be
visually simpler than longer ones to make the overall diagram easier to read.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>This was a short post and probably not that exciting, I know. To be frank I
didn&rsquo;t really feel like writing (or publishing) it, but given that this year
resolution is to publish a post per month and that I&rsquo;m already one month late I
figured I should just write it anyway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll end this post with a couple of diagrams <code>ascii-diagrams</code> is able to
generate.  Take a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/d-dorazio/ascii-diagrams">repo</a> if you&rsquo;d like to know more
about how to actually use it.</p>
