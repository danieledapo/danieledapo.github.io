      Signals from the past
    </a>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>It&rsquo;s just common knowledge that pressing Ctrl-C will usually terminate a long running command in a shell.
How cool is that? But, how does it work?</p>
<p>Every developer that has done some little system programming on Linux knows that
the answer is <em>signals</em>. They are defined in the POSIX standard and are a (very)
limited form of inter-process communication. The idea is really simple: a signal
is sent to a program to notify it that an event has occurred. It could be the
Ctrl-C event(aka <code>SIGINT</code>) or the request of program termination(<code>SIGTERM</code>).</p>
<p>The really interesting part is that programs can react to those events providing really cool features.
It&rsquo;s extremely convenient to abort the compilation(without corrupting anything)
of the Linux kernel just by pressing Ctrl-C, isn&rsquo;t it? Therefore one would think that such a useful
thing to have would be <em>trivial</em> to implement, right? Wrong. It&rsquo;s really a pain. Let&rsquo;s see why.</p>
<h2 id="at-the-beginning-there-was-signal">At the beginning there was signal</h2>
<p>As defined in the POSIX standard, the primitive for registering a callback to a signal is
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html"><code>signal</code></a>. The semantic is pretty easy,
just call it with the signal you&rsquo;re interested in and provide the proper callback.</p>
<p>It turns out writing a correct signal handler is way more harder than writing a multi-threaded
program. The problem is that your program stops as soon as it catches the signal, no matter what it was
doing. That means that <em>everything</em> could possibly be in an inconsistent state(yes, even if you protect
your code with locks). At this point I&rsquo;m hearing you saying: &ldquo;hey, what can I do in the handler then?&rdquo;. Well,
there are some system calls that are <em>guaranteed</em> to work(<code>open</code> for example), but they&rsquo;re really
just a few and even basic functions like <code>printf</code> are not in there because they acquire locks internally.</p>
<p>The probably safest way to write a signal handler is to set a <code>sig_atomic_t</code> flag(that is guaranteed to work)
once a signal arrives and then poll that flag and do something useful when it&rsquo;s set. Polling is always your friend.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s ignore the above for now, there is another pitfall in using <code>signal</code>: the signal handler gets reset
after the signal is received. Ok, you say, I&rsquo;m gonna register the handler again in the handler itself and that&rsquo;s it.
Unfortunately no, because it&rsquo;s possible that another signal arrives in the meantime and that&rsquo;s a race condition.</p>
<p>Ok, <code>signal</code> is broken, let&rsquo;s build something new.</p>
<h2 id="then-sigaction-came">Then sigaction came</h2>
<p><code>signal</code> was replaced by <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/rt_sigaction.2.html"><code>sigaction</code></a> and
obviously that works perfectly&hellip;&lt;/sarcasm&gt; It suffers the same usability problem of <code>signal</code>. However,
it introduced some interesting ideas. For example it&rsquo;s possible to retrieve some useful information
about the signal like the sender process pid or the user id(see the <code>siginfo_t</code> struct
and the <code>sa_sigaction</code> attribute in <code>sigaction</code>).</p>
<h2 id="along-with-sigwait">&hellip;along with sigwait</h2>
<p>Then some clever folks thought that we could just block the current thread until a signal arrives;
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sigwait.3.html"><code>sigwait</code></a> was born. It turns out that&rsquo;s a pretty usable
and easy API. Just spawn another thread that blocks until one of a given set of signals arrives and do something
according to the signal received. This way the code would run &ldquo;normally&rdquo; without interrupting the normal execution
of the code eliminating the limitation of the signal handler. That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Though, with threads come great responsibility. You need to properly protect shared variables with locks
and so forth, but we&rsquo;re more confident with these kind of problems than with weird interrupt ones.
Moreover, threads have their own sigmask and that can cause some problems, because a thread could
ignore some signals that are worth catching.</p>
<p>This works, but we can do better.</p>
<h2 id="and-signalfd-eventually-killed-them-all">&hellip;and signalfd eventually killed them all</h2>
<p>Some other folks then thought that we could just expose the events via a file descriptor following
the UNIX philosophy. That rocks, UNIX rocks. Once we have a file descriptor we can rule the world!
We can integrate with existing event loops such as <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html"><code>epoll</code></a>
or <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html"><code>select</code></a> or we can just call the
sync functions. Everything that&rsquo;s left to us is just reading the <code>siginfo_t</code> from the file descriptor
and call the appropriate function for the signal received. That&rsquo;s what I mean for &ldquo;easy&rdquo;.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="funny-things">Funny things</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>signals are aggregated, that means that on the imaginary &ldquo;signals queue&rdquo; there
will be at most one instance of any signals. This problem affects
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/signalfd.2.html"><code>signalfd</code></a> as well as
<code>signal</code> and <code>sigaction</code>, but I don&rsquo;t really see where the problem is, because
you eventually get the signal&hellip;;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>most system calls can be interrupted by a signal and in those cases they
return <code>EINTR</code> that is &ldquo;the call was interrupted, please retry but consider
what we&rsquo;ve done so far&rdquo;; I always wondered why there are that big warnings in
several programming languages docs saying that the API could return less
things than it was asked for. This is certainly a reason.</p>
