      2019 in Review
    </a>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>The year is coming to an end and I guess it&rsquo;s time to take a look at what one
has accomplished in the past 365 days.</p>
<p>I had two main goals this year: do more side projects and blog more. My plan
was to do at least a project per month and as soon as it&rsquo;s in a &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;
complete state write a post about it.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see what projects I made during this year.</p>
<h2 id="chip8-emulatorhttpsgithubcomdanieledapochip8"><a href="https://github.com/danieledapo/chip8">Chip8 emulator</a></h2>
<p>This was the first project of the year and I think it was one of funniest. It&rsquo;s
a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8">chip8</a> emulator capable of
running simple games like PONG.</p>
<p>It was a ton of fun because I learned a bit more about how emulators work and I
got to play with WebAssembly and Rust. Under a non technology point of view,
this project was interesting because I realized that even if I had the core of
the project done in a couple of days, I spent a lot more time polishing things
like making the web ui nicer. A project is not only the core algorithm I guess.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can find the emulator at <a href="https://danieledapo.github.io/chip8">https://danieledapo.github.io/chip8</a> and a
blog post <a href="/post/chip8-emulator-rs">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="chip8-screenshot.png" alt="chip8-screenshot"></p>
<h2 id="sudoku-solverhttpsgithubcomdanieledaposudoku-rs"><a href="https://github.com/danieledapo/sudoku-rs">Sudoku solver</a></h2>
<p>I like Sudoku, it&rsquo;s a fun game that I usually play when I&rsquo;m bored at the
airport, but still. I decided to write a solver (and generator) for it.</p>
<p>I thought it was a hard problem given the quite big search space, but it turns
out that you can prune the search space aggressively by just following the
rules. It didn&rsquo;t took me very long to come up with a reasonably fast solver and
then a generator. I also implemented a couple (probably unneeded) optimizations
because bit twiddling is always a fun thing to do.</p>
<p><img src="sudoku-screenshot.png" alt="sudoku-screenshot"></p>
<h2 id="jvhttpsgithubcomdanieledapojv"><a href="https://github.com/danieledapo/jv">JV</a></h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this was a fun project, but sure enough it was frustrating.
It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; json viewer that allows to use
<a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>-like queries to search for elements in a
JSON document. It also supports automatic jumping to the path under the cursor
if it&rsquo;s a valid query. Incidentally this also works as a simple file viewer.</p>
<p>The part that was annoying was text rendering, in particular handling the width
of a character. I thought that as long as we stick with ASCII (I&rsquo;m sorry, but
handling the width of unicode codepoints is really a pain) it should always be
one. Then the tab &lsquo;\t&rsquo; character came along and I started crying&hellip;</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m proud to say that tab characters are properly handled by JV and
that it proved useful a bunch of times.</p>
<p>If you really want to know more about my frustrutations then I wrote a
<a href="/post/jv">post</a> for you.</p>
<p><img src="jv-screenshot.png" alt="jv-screenshot"></p>
<h2 id="buzzhttpsgithubcomdanieledapor3d"><a href="https://github.com/danieledapo/r3d">Buzz</a></h2>
<p>This was the hardest, but most satisfying project among all the other projects
I&rsquo;ve done this year. It&rsquo;s a toy ray tracer that I wrote to learn more about the
topic and about rendering in general.</p>
<p>It was a blast, I learned a bunch of things and I realized the effort it goes
into making a scene look good. Even more so if it&rsquo;s just a frame of an
animation!</p>
<p>This was my entry point to the world of computer graphics which is something I
realized I like playing with from time to time.</p>
<p>Since this was a big project I definitely wanted to write a post and
<a href="/post/buzz">there</a> you have it!</p>
<p><img src="/post/buzz/csg.png" alt="buzz-csg"></p>
<h2 id="diffusion-limited-aggregationhttpsgithubcomdanieledapodla"><a href="https://github.com/danieledapo/dla">Diffusion limited aggregation</a></h2>
<p>As soon as Buzz got into a &ldquo;working&rdquo; state I wanted to use it to render some
cool looking scenes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion-limited_aggregation">diffusion limited
aggregation</a>
seemed like a cool thing to try.</p>
<p>DLA is a process that simulates Brownian motion which results in dendric and
snowflaky shapes. I think it can be done in any number of dimensions but at
least in 2D and 3D the resulting patterns are quite interesting.</p>
<p>I intended to write a blog post about this because I particularly enjoyed
working on this project, but for whatever reason I did not. Maybe in the
future.</p>
<img src="/post/2019-in-review/dla-small.png" alt="dla-small" class="image-centered">
<h2 id="isolines---marching-squareshttpsgithubcomdanieledapomarching-squares-rs"><a href="https://github.com/danieledapo/marching-squares-rs">Isolines - marching squares</a></h2>
<p>At this point, I needed a break from Buzz because it&rsquo;s best not to overdo and I
decided to play around with isolines. I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by
topographic maps. I&rsquo;m not sure why, I guess I like lines.</p>
<p>Anyway, I decided to implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares">marching square
algorithm</a> that allows to find
the paths in an image at a given &ldquo;height&rdquo; (technically speaking above a given
threshold, but meh&hellip;). If we simply use it to find the paths at different
heights then we have a simple topographic map!</p>
<p>I like the topographic maps I&rsquo;m able to generate starting from an heightmap and
I&rsquo;m thinking about printing (or even pen plotting) some just for fun.</p>
<p>I think this was worth a blog post, but I was lazy and didn&rsquo;t write any.</p>
<p><img src="italy.png" alt="italy.png"></p>
<h2 id="terrain-mesh-generationhttpsgithubcomdanieledapoterrain-mesh"><a href="https://github.com/danieledapo/terrain-mesh">Terrain mesh generation</a></h2>
<p>On the same note as the previous project, I started wondering if I could
generate a 3D mesh resembling a mountain or terrain. It turned out to be quite
easy once I found out about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">Perlin
noise</a>. I spent more time writing
the code that actually connects the mesh than tuning the terrain generation
parameters.</p>
<p>The best thing about this project is that eventually I was able to 3d print
some of the generated meshes!</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="/post/terrain-mesh-from-noise">post</a> about this, yay!</p>
<p><img src="/post/terrain-mesh/terrain.png" alt="random-terrain"></p>
<h2 id="delaunay-meshhttpsgithubcomdanieledapodelaunay-mesh"><a href="https://github.com/danieledapo/delaunay-mesh">Delaunay mesh</a></h2>
<p>This was more of an experiment than an actual project since I was mostly
playing around with triangulation with no clear goal in mind. You won&rsquo;t find
anything too interesting here, it&rsquo;s just an (inefficient) implementation of a
triangulation algorithm.</p>
<p><img src="delaunay.png" alt="delaunay"></p>
<h2 id="morse-clihttpsgithubcomdanieledapomorse"><a href="https://github.com/danieledapo/morse">Morse CLI</a></h2>
<p>This was a funny one, not particularly challenging but it was nice nonetheless.
It&rsquo;s a very simple CLI that allows to encode and decode ASCII text in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code">Morse
code</a>. I also implemented a very
simple play feature that allows to actually hear what Morse sounds like.</p>
<p><img src="morse-screenshot.png" alt="morse"></p>
<h2 id="four-color-mapshttpsgithubcomdanieledapo4color-map"><a href="https://github.com/danieledapo/4color-map">Four-Color maps</a></h2>
<p>This was the last project of the year, it&rsquo;s an absolutely non mathematical
proof that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem">Four-Color
theorem</a> holds. The theorem
says that any given planar map can be colored using at most four colors and
what&rsquo;s the best way to test it than actually generating some maps and trying to
color them? That&rsquo;s exactly what I did.</p>
<p>Ironically, the hardest part of the project was not finding whether a map (or
graph) could be colored with at most four colors, but instead generating a good
looking random map. I implemented a voronoi like map generation which works
reasonably well, but I think there are better ways.</p>
<p>Also, this made me realize that I like maps more than I thought.</p>
<p><img src="4color-map.svg" alt="4color-map"></p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>If I&rsquo;m ok with the amount and kind of projects I managed to do, I&rsquo;m definitely
not with the amount of posts I&rsquo;ve written as I&rsquo;ve written only five. There are
some projects that I think are worth a post either because they&rsquo;re interesting
or because I put a lot of effort in them, but I was too lazy or tired to
actually write it.</p>
<p>My resolutions for 2020 are basically the same that is a project per month and
blog post about it except that this time I want to be more strict on the latter.</p>
<p>Happy new year!</p>
