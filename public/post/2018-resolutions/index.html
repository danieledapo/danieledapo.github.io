      2018 Resolutions
    </a>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>I&rsquo;ve just finished watching
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)">Interstellar</a> for probably
the 7th time since it came out and I really enjoy it every time. The soundtrack
is amazing and it adds a completely new dimension to the movie. The plot is
literally mind blowing, but I know that a lot of people don&rsquo;t get it. I don&rsquo;t
care, I understand the amount of pieces I need to find it interesting and that&rsquo;s
enough for me. It should come as no surprise that Interstellar is one of my
favorite movies. If you haven&rsquo;t watched it yet then stop reading and go watch
it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve digressed enough, let&rsquo;s talk about new my year&rsquo;s resolutions. I
know I&rsquo;m kind of late to the party since 2018 started more than a week ago, but
here I am nonetheless. The reason why I&rsquo;m writing this down is that I believe
that by sharing it publicly I&rsquo;ll feel obliged in actually pursuing my goals. So
here are my new year&rsquo;s resolutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>first of all, I&rsquo;d like to start writing blog posts for real this time. I
actually started this blog more than a year ago, but I only published a single
post since then. The reasons why I want to have a blog didn&rsquo;t change. I find
myself thinking a lot about many different problems and I think that by
writing them down they&rsquo;ll become more clear in my head. If other people find
them interesting then that&rsquo;s a bonus point ðŸ˜„. I also want to improve at
writing(in English) and at exposing ideas in general. I think I&rsquo;m pretty bad
at the latter and I really want to improve.</li>
<li>I plan on doing some public talks mostly for the same reasons I want to have
this blog. I already have some ideas for an introductory workshop on
functional programming concepts. Stay tuned for a blog post in case I give
this talk.</li>
<li>build something useful. I feel like I didn&rsquo;t build or learn much in the past
year and that really sucks. I definitely want to do something this year
though. Whatever I&rsquo;ll build, I&rsquo;ll use either Haskell or Rust, because those
are my top 2 languages as of now. I know this is pretty vague, but bear with
me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope for a great new year!</p>
