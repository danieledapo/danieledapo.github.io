    <p>JSON is a really common format and I think it works well 90% of the time.
However, it&rsquo;s not perfect and it lacks some features that would be handy
sometimes.</p>
<p>In particular, it doesn&rsquo;t have a way to specify a reference to a value in the
document. A common solution is to store the id of the referenced object, but
it&rsquo;s not always possible (or convenient) to do so.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s trivial to come up with a custom string format that represents a
path to a value. For example, consider the following JSON document</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span style="display:flex;"><span>{
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#062873;font-weight:bold">&#34;people&#34;</span>: [{ <span style="color:#062873;font-weight:bold">&#34;name&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#4070a0">&#34;Dan&#34;</span> }, { <span style="color:#062873;font-weight:bold">&#34;name&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#4070a0">&#34;Luke&#34;</span> }, { <span style="color:#062873;font-weight:bold">&#34;name&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#4070a0">&#34;Frank&#34;</span> }]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>A very simple reference format could support the following queries:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#/</code> is the document root;</li>
<li><code>#/people</code> is the path to the &ldquo;people&rdquo; array;</li>
<li><code>#/people/0</code> maps to the first object inside the &ldquo;people&rdquo; array;</li>
<li><code>#/people/0/name</code> maps to the &ldquo;name&rdquo; of the first object inside the &ldquo;people&rdquo;
array;</li>
</ul>
<p>We could then store these paths inside the JSON document to express
relationships between values. For example, we could add a &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; key to
every object in the &ldquo;people&rdquo; array.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span style="display:flex;"><span>{
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#062873;font-weight:bold">&#34;people&#34;</span>: [
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    { <span style="color:#062873;font-weight:bold">&#34;name&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#4070a0">&#34;Dan&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#062873;font-weight:bold">&#34;brothers&#34;</span>: [<span style="color:#4070a0">&#34;#/people/2&#34;</span>] },
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    { <span style="color:#062873;font-weight:bold">&#34;name&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#4070a0">&#34;Luke&#34;</span> },
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    { <span style="color:#062873;font-weight:bold">&#34;name&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#4070a0">&#34;Frank&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#062873;font-weight:bold">&#34;brothers&#34;</span>: [<span style="color:#4070a0">&#34;#/people/0&#34;</span>] }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  ]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>At work I have to deal with JSON documents like these all the time and I can say
they&rsquo;re particularly annoying to inspect because they require a lot of jumping
between values. At the time, I was using <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> to query the document but, besides
having to convert the above reference format to the one jq likes, there doesn&rsquo;t
seem to exist a sort of &ldquo;interactive jq&rdquo; that supports moving inside a JSON
document and jumping to the reference under the cursor.</p>
<p>Eventually I was so frustrated that I decided to shave this yak by myself and I
started <a href="https://github.com/d-dorazio/jv">jv</a>: a terminal application to quickly inspect json documents with
first class support for jumping to references.</p>
<h2 id="viewer">Viewer</h2>
<p>To start things off, I started implementing all the basic features like cursor
movement, paging, line truncation, JSON syntax highlighting, formatting, etc&hellip;
and things were going smoothly until one night I realized I was doing it wrong.</p>
<p>All the code I wrote up until that moment was assuming that each character would
take up exactly one column when printed to the terminal, but that is not always
the case! In fact, a lot of Unicode characters, namely emojis or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_Unified_Ideographs">CJK
ideographs</a>, can span multiple columns!</p>
<p>Armed with hope, I tried to understand if there was some sort of table that
defines the width of every Unicode symbol when rendered. I went through the
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/">Unicode Annex #11</a> page which describes how to interoperate
with Asian character sets and I realized that the thing is tricky to handle to
say the least.</p>
<p>Since I don&rsquo;t have to deal with Unicode documents at work (and I&rsquo;m lazy) I took
the shortest route that is to enforce that the input text contains only ASCII
characters.</p>
<p>Initially I thought this was the easiest part of the project, but I was so
wrong. This was the most annoying and energy consuming part of it.</p>
<h2 id="tabs">Tabs</h2>
<p>If I can live without supporting Unicode characters, I do want to support tabs
mostly for a matter of honour. I think tabs should not be used anymore because
they&rsquo;re a thing of the past, but lots of software(e.g. Go, Make, the Linux
kernel, etc&hellip;) do not agree and instead they make heavy use of tabs.</p>
<p>Initially I thought that I could just simply replace each tab with 8 spaces or
whatever the tab width is and be done with it. Poor me.</p>
<p>Tabs are not always of a fixed size because they depend on the position they&rsquo;re
rendered from! In fact, a tab spans all the columns until the next tab stop
which is usually at every 8 columns. Hopefully the following examples will make
it more clear.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ <span style="color:#007020">printf</span> <span style="color:#4070a0">&#39;########\tciaociao\t########&#39;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic"># output: ########        ciaociao        ########</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ <span style="color:#007020">printf</span> <span style="color:#4070a0">&#39;########\tciao\t########&#39;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic"># output: ########        ciao    ########</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ <span style="color:#007020">printf</span> <span style="color:#4070a0">&#39;#######\tX\t########&#39;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic"># output: ####### X       ########</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This was really annoying to implement because I don&rsquo;t like that the model has to
know how and where it will be rendered in order to change its representation. It
doesn&rsquo;t sound right to me. Anyway, with enough hacks I was able to get it
working.</p>
<h2 id="jv">JV</h2>
<p>After I managed to implement all of this, adding the real core functionality was
pretty much straightforward.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a small demo that shows some of what <a href="https://github.com/d-dorazio/jv">jv</a> can do.</p>
<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/233199"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/233199.svg" alt="asciicast"></a></p>
<p>I plan to add some more features in the near-ish future. For example, it really
needs a search mode where you can search for plain strings inside the document.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not proud of the code I&rsquo;ve written. I think there are a lot of abstractions
that I could have come up with to make the code cleaner and my life easier, but
I was so frustrated of all the hacks I had to put in the code that I didn&rsquo;t have
enough energy and will for refactoring.</p>
<p>Anyway, <code>jv</code> is already proving useful at my daily job so I&rsquo;m done with it as of
now. It&rsquo;s not pretty, but it kinda works. After all, an ugly tool is still
better than nothing.</p>
