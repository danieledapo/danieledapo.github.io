      Buzz, the ray tracer!
    </a>
  </p>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been working on a toy ray tracer to learn a bit about how 3D
renderers work. I also took the opportunity to learn a little bit of math and a
whole ton about computer graphics in general. This post isn&rsquo;t a tutorial on how
to build a ray tracer because there&rsquo;s a ton of resources online already; it is
mostly the journey I went through when writing Buzz, my toy ray tracer.</p>
<p>For the impatient, the source code of the whole project lives on
<a href="https://github.com/danieledapo/r3d.git">github</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-all-started">How it all started</h2>
<p>More than a month ago I was watching Toy Story which is a thing I always love
to do from time to time. That time I was particularly attracted by a scene
where Buzz LightYear uses its laser to shoot rays everywhere to locate the
enemies. That scene reminded me of how ray tracers work and so I decided to
build one.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know very much about 3D and sure enough ray tracing was no exception, so
the first thing I had to do was to gather some resources and read some
documentation. To my surprise, I found out that a lot of ink has been spilled
over this topic! After a bit of searching, I decided to follow <a href="https://github.com/petershirley/raytracinginoneweekend">Writing a Ray
Tracer in a Weekend</a> because it seemed a good compromise between
theory and practice. I don&rsquo;t regret this choice, but probably it was a bit too
light on theory.</p>
<h2 id="ray-tracing-101">Ray Tracing 101</h2>
<p>A ray tracer is a type of 3D renderer whose only purpose is to transform the
description of a 3D scene into an image in the most accurate way possible. In
order to do that it shoots a <em>bunch</em> of light rays into the scene and then it
simulates how such rays reflect and refract to find out the color of every pixel
in the final image.</p>
<p>If this sounds expensive to you, you&rsquo;re right! It&rsquo;s really way more expensive
than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasterisation">rasterisation</a> for example, but on the other hand the
rendered image is way closer to reality especially when looking at shadows.</p>
<p>The core idea of the algorithm can be summarized by the following code snippet.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">for</span> (x, y) <span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">in</span> output_image:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">for</span> _ <span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">in</span> <span style="color:#40a070">0.</span><span style="color:#666">.</span>nsamples:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        color <span style="color:#666">=</span> shoot_ray(ray_going_through(camera, (x, y)))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        output_image<span style="color:#666">.</span>blend_pixel(x, y, color)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Quite neat, isn&rsquo;t it? Obviously I&rsquo;ve omitted where all the magic happens (that
is in <code>shoot_ray</code>) but I think that is a good overview of how ray tracing
works. It basically goes through each pixel of the final image, shoots slightly
different rays into the scene and eventually blends all the potentially
different colors for the same pixel.</p>
<p>The difficult part of ray tracing is in writing an efficient <code>shoot_ray</code>
function. Conceptually, all it does is to find the closest intersection (if any)
between the ray and the objects in the scene and then according to which object
it hit and its material it calculates the color of the pixel.</p>
<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>
<p>Coming up with a faithful representation of materials is hard and it turns out
that this is very much a research area to this day. In fact there are a lot of
ways to model materials with varying degrees of complexity and realism. I choose
to implement only the lambertian(aka diffuse), metal and dielectric(aka glass)
materials because they seemed the easiest to implement.</p>
<p>Among the three, the lambertian material was the easiest to implement because it
turns out that a relatively good model consists in simply bouncing the incoming
ray approximately along the normal of the intersected object. This ends up in
simulating a perfectly diffuse material.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06287e">lambertian_bounce</span>(ray, obj):
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    (intersection_point, normal) <span style="color:#666">=</span> obj<span style="color:#666">.</span>intersect(ray)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">return</span> Ray(intersection_point, normal <span style="color:#666">+</span> randUnitVector())
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Metal materials were a bit harder to implement because they do not simply make
the incoming ray bounce in a random direction but instead such ray is reflected
and then slightly perturbed. Intuitively this makes sense because pure metals
simply reflect light rays.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06287e">diffuse_bounce</span>(ray, obj):
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    (intersection_point, normal) <span style="color:#666">=</span> obj<span style="color:#666">.</span>intersect(ray)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">return</span> Ray(intersection_point, reflect(ray<span style="color:#666">.</span>direction, normal) <span style="color:#666">+</span> randUnitVector())
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Dielectric materials were the hardest to understand and to code. These materials
look like glass and do not simply reflect incoming rays but instead they let
some amount of rays go through the object (refraction) and others are reflected.
The ratio between reflected and refracted rays are ruled by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations">Fresnel
factor</a> which I decided to simulate by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlick's_approximation">Schlick&rsquo;s
approximation equations</a>. Practically this means that each time
a ray hits a dielectric material Buzz randomly generates a probability and
according to whether it&rsquo;s greater or smaller than the Fresnel factor for that
particular material it reflects or refracts the incoming ray. Quite mouthful I
know, but hopefully the following code snippet will clarify things a bit.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06287e">dielectric_bounce</span>(ray, obj):

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">return</span> refracted
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>With just these three types of materials it&rsquo;s possible to render quite
interesting and pleasing scenes like the following even though the materials do
not look very realistic because real materials are actually a mix of the
diffuse, metal and dielectric components, but I&rsquo;m ok with what I have for now.</p>

<h2 id="mesh">Mesh</h2>
<p>At this point I implemented pretty much everything that Ray tracing in a weekend
covered, but I wasn&rsquo;t satisfied yet. What I wanted to tackle next was to add
support for rendering arbitrary meshes so that I would be able to render complex
objects and not just boring geometric shapes.</p>
<p>It turned out to be quite simple because a mesh can be seen as just a collection
of faces, triangles in my case, which share the same material. It&rsquo;s not that
different than inserting such faces directly in the scene as objects with the
same material. In fact, that is basically what I do. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the
most correct way to do this, but I think that it&rsquo;s quite simple and gives good
results.</p>
<p><img src="/post/buzz/suzanne.png" alt="suzanne"></p>
<h2 id="constructive-solid-geometry">Constructive Solid Geometry</h2>
<p>While studying ray tracers and in general learning more about 3D rendering I
came across the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry">Constructive Solid Geometry</a> or CSG. The core
idea is to have simple primitive objects like spheres, cubes, etc&hellip; and then to
use boolean operators (i.e. union, intersection and difference) to combine them
together. Being a big fan of functional programming and composition in general,
this concept really spoke to me and I decided that Buzz had to be able to render
this kind of shapes.</p>
<p>The implementation was quite straightforward, I modelled the primitives using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_distance_function">Signed Distance Functions</a> or SDF. Signed distance
functions are a way to look at objects as functions that return the distance
from a point to the object&rsquo;s surface. If the distance is negative then the point
is inside the object, if it&rsquo;s zero then it&rsquo;s exactly on the surface and if it&rsquo;s
positive it&rsquo;s outside the object. Here&rsquo;s an example SDF for spheres</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">class</span> <span style="color:#0e84b5;font-weight:bold">Sphere</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    center: Vec3
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    radius: <span style="color:#007020">float</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06287e">dist</span>(self, point):
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        <span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">return</span> (point <span style="color:#666">-</span> self<span style="color:#666">.</span>center)<span style="color:#666">.</span>norm() <span style="color:#666">-</span> self<span style="color:#666">.</span>radius
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Implementing the boolean operators on these primitives took me a bit of time,
but I enjoyed the process nonetheless. The union between two SDF is simply the
minimum distance between the two while the intersection is simply taking the
maximum. Intuitively this means that the distance of a union object to a point
is the distance of the closest object to that point and symmetrically for the
intersection object. The difference operator is a bit more involved but it boils
down to taking the intersection between the first object and everything but the
second that is the intersection between the first object and the negation of the
second. The negation can be done by simply changing the sign of a SDF.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06287e">union</span>(sdf1, sdf2, point):

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06287e">intersection</span>(sdf1, sdf2, point):
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">return</span> <span style="color:#007020">max</span>(sdf1<span style="color:#666">.</span>dist(point), sdf2<span style="color:#666">.</span>dist(point))

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is all pretty cool but unfortunately this isn&rsquo;t enough to render CSG
objects because usually ray tracers need to find the intersection point on the
object to properly calculate the normal for shading, etc&hellip; However, CSG can
only provide distances because that&rsquo;s the whole point of representing models
using SDF after all. Fear not though, there&rsquo;s a technique known as ray marching
that basically consists in moving along the incoming ray by its distance from
the SDF object until such distance is 0 that is when the origin of the ray is
the intersection point.</p>
<p>Using these simple operators it&rsquo;s possible to describe quite complex objects
like the following.</p>
<p><img src="/post/buzz/csg.png" alt="csg-image"></p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Ray tracers are pretty cool and are interesting to implement, but it&rsquo;s not a
walk in the park if you don&rsquo;t know much about 3d math. The best part of this
journey was that I could see the results of my code changes pretty much
immediately because they almost always impacted the final images. I didn&rsquo;t like
debugging though, it&rsquo;s super hard given that it&rsquo;s not always obvious what&rsquo;s
causing weird effects in the final image.</p>
<p>There a lot of features missing in Buzz like textures and volume rendering,
but I&rsquo;m ok with what I have.</p>
<p>A feature that I&rsquo;m considering adding is some very basic primitives to render
animations given that I&rsquo;m able to render images which can be seen as frames.
However, since rendering a single good quality image takes a bit of time, I fear
that making an animation of say 1 minute would require quite a bit of resources.
It&rsquo;d be pretty cool to produce short movies though.</p>
<p>Also, I might try to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering">Physically based rendering</a> at some point,
but I&rsquo;m done with ray tracing for the foreseeable future. The next thing is to
build a rasterizer to explore the other face of 3D rendering. See you then.</p>
